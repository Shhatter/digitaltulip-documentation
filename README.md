This repository is purely a collection of documents explaining the DigitalTulip project and its associated collateral. 

##What is Digital Tulip

Digital Tulip was a program of work started back in February of 2015 to demonstrate a capability of Atos building cloud native solutions. The objective was to prove this through demonstration rather than powerpoint presentations. As a result a number of working application components were developed and deployed into an Amazon Web Services environment.
